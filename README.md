# YoutubePlaylistUpgrade

## Intro

A web app that allows user to log in with their YouTube acounts and access their playlists in a more comfortable interface. The new UI displays more video in a grid layout and allow users to search videos inside the playlsit by keyword. Besides, users can also delete, move, and copy videos between playlists by group.

The app is built with [OAuth2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) and [Youtube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlists/list). 

Due to the policy of YouTube, users cannot access the 'Watch later' playlist for now.
